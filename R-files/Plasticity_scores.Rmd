## Experimental Setup

**Species:**  
- *Arabidopsis thaliana*  
- *Capsella bursa-pastoris*

**Growth Conditions:**  
- Different temperature regimes  
- Varying nitrogen levels in the soil

**Measurement Variation:**  
- Five distinct parameter combinations for each condition

## Experimental Treatments and GC-MS Analysis

**GC-MS Analysis (example pipeline on [DOI: 10.1111/pce.14146](https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.14146))**

Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is performed to analyze the biochemical changes in plants subjected to stress conditions. The following steps are involved:

1. **Sample Preparation:**  
   - Plant tissues (e.g., leaves, roots) are harvested at specified time points.
   - The tissues are immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further analysis.
   - For GC-MS, the samples are ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen.

2. **Metabolite Extraction:**  
   - The powdered plant material is extracted using a solvent mixture, typically methanol or a combination of methanol and water.
   - The mixture is vortexed and centrifuged to separate the supernatant containing the metabolites.

3. **Derivatization:**  
   - The extracted metabolites are derivatized to make them more volatile and suitable for GC-MS analysis.
   - This often involves the use of derivatizing agents such as N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) to convert the metabolites into their trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives.

4. **GC-MS Conditions:**  
   - The derivatized samples are injected into a GC-MS system.
   - The GC is equipped with a suitable capillary column (e.g., DB-5MS) and operated under a temperature gradient.
   - The column temperature is gradually increased to separate the metabolites.

5. **MS Detection:**  
   - The separated metabolites are detected using mass spectrometry.
   - The MS detector operates in electron ionization (EI) mode, scanning over a specified mass range to identify the metabolites based on their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios.

6. **Data Analysis:**  
   - The GC-MS data are analyzed using software to identify and quantify the metabolites.
   - The retention times and mass spectra are compared with reference libraries to confirm the identities of the compounds.
   - The relative abundances of the metabolites are calculated to assess the biochemical changes induced by stress treatments.

The GC-MS analysis provides insights into the metabolic adjustments in plants in response to abiotic stresses, revealing how epigenetic modifications might influence these biochemic

## Diversity Panels
Diversity panels are collections of different accessions (genetically distinct lines) used to study genetic diversity, natural variation, and genotype-phenotype associations.

## Reaction Norms of the Trait Data
 A ‘reaction norm’ describes the sensitivity of an organism, or of a set of organisms of the same genotype (e.g., the members of a clone), to some specific environmental variable. It quantifies phenotypic change (or lack of change) in a selected aspect of the phenotype as a function of variation in the environmental factor of interest. The reaction norm approach treats environmental sensitivity as a continuously variable response. 

## Nominal Approaches for Quantifying Plasticity
Nominal approaches involve analyzing trait data from a single genotype across various environments. These methods rely on the concept of the reaction norm, which visualizes how trait values of a genotype change across different environments. This approach primarily uses two key concepts:

1. **Slope of the Regression Line**
   - Represents the rate of change in the trait value relative to the environmental variable.
   
2. **Residual Mean Square Error**
   - Quantifies the deviation of actual trait values from the predicted values by the regression line.
   - Suitable when the trait changes linearly with environmental changes.

For traits that do not exhibit linear changes (e.g., enzyme activity with respect to pH), other approaches are required.

### Other Nominal Measures of Plasticity
- **Range**
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum trait values.
  
- **Standard Deviation**
  
- **Coefficient of Variation**
  - The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, indicating relative variability.
  
- **Stability Index**
  - Quantifies the consistency of trait values across environments.

## Relative Approaches for Quantifying Plasticity
Relative approaches involve analyzing a single trait across multiple genotypes in the same environments. Here are the key points:

1. **Breaking Down Variance**
   - The total variance of a trait is split into parts due to the genotype, the environment, and their interactions. ANOVA helps in determining these components.

2. **Genotype-by-Environment Interaction**
   - This interaction measures how plasticity varies across different genotypes, rather than within a single genotype.

### Finlay and Wilkinson Method

The Finlay-Wilkinson regression is a method used in agronomy and plant breeding to analyze genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE). This technique helps in understanding how different genotypes (e.g., crop varieties) perform across a range of environmental conditions. Finlay-Wilkinson regression is designed to assess the stability and adaptability of different genotypes in varying environments. It aims to identify which genotypes are consistently high-performing across different environments and which ones are more sensitive to environmental changes.




- **Environmental Index**
  - Assumes the interaction between genotype and environment depends on an environmental index.
  
- **Regression Analysis**
  - Trait values for each genotype are compared against the average trait values of all genotypes in each environment.
  
- **Relative Measures**
  - The slope and mean square error from these comparisons provide plasticity measures for each genotype.

#### Example for 
```{r}
# Creating a toy dataset
data <- data.frame(
  Environment = rep(1:5, each = 3),
  Genotype = rep(c("G1", "G2", "G3"), times = 5),
  Yield = c(2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 
            2.8, 3.2, 3.6, 
            3.0, 3.4, 3.8,
            3.2, 3.5, 4.0,
            3.5, 3.7, 4.2)
)

# Display the dataset
print(data)

# Calculate environmental means
env_means <- aggregate(Yield ~ Environment, data = data, mean)
colnames(env_means) <- c("Environment", "EnvMean")

# Merge environmental means with original data
data <- merge(data, env_means, by = "Environment")

# Fit regression models for each genotype
fit_G1 <- lm(Yield ~ EnvMean, data = data[data$Genotype == "G1",])
fit_G2 <- lm(Yield ~ EnvMean, data = data[data$Genotype == "G2",])
fit_G3 <- lm(Yield ~ EnvMean, data = data[data$Genotype == "G3",])

# Display summary of each model
summary(fit_G1)
summary(fit_G2)
summary(fit_G3)

# Plotting the results
ggplot(data, aes(x = EnvMean, y = Yield, color = Genotype)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Finlay-Wilkinson Regression Lines",
       x = "Environmental Mean Yield",
       y = "Genotype Yield") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

* slope close to 1 indicates average stability, meaning the genotype's performance changes proportionally with the environmental factor
* A slope greater than 1 indicates that the genotype is more responsive to environmental improvements (high performance in favorable environments but poor performance in unfavorable ones)
* A slope less than 1 indicates greater stability and lower responsiveness to environmental changes, suggesting the genotype performs relatively consistently across different environments.


## Epigenetics and their influence on plasticity

Plants, being sessile, are constantly exposed to various environmental stresses. To survive and adapt to these conditions, they undergo epigenetic modifications. Epigenomics, the study of large-scale epigenetic marks on the genome, includes changes like histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination) and small RNA machinery. These modifications play a crucial role in gene expression regulation and phenotypic plasticity under stress.

## Types of Epigenetic Changes in Plants
### Histone Acetylation
Histone acetylation involves the addition of acetyl groups to lysine residues on histone proteins, regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This modification reduces the electrostatic affinity between histones and DNA, allowing transcription. For example, under drought stress, specific HAT genes in wheat are upregulated, contributing to drought resistance.

### DNA Methylation
DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine, is a reversible process that regulates gene expression, growth, and stress responses. For instance, drought conditions lead to increased CG hypermethylation in the pea genome, contributing to stress adaptation.

### Phosphorylation
Histone phosphorylation, particularly of histone H3, plays a role in DNA repair, chromosome condensation, and transcription regulation. Under osmotic stress, phosphorylation of H3T3 in Arabidopsis helps maintain heterochromatin structure and gene repression.

### Ubiquitination
Ubiquitination involves attaching ubiquitin molecules to target proteins, affecting their stability and function. In wheat, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TaPUB1 enhances salt tolerance by upregulating ion channel-related genes.

### Small RNA Machinery
Small RNAs, including miRNAs and siRNAs, play significant roles in stress responses. For example, in Arabidopsis, miRNAs regulate genes involved in proline accumulation, enhancing salt stress tolerance.

## Influence of Different Stresses on the Epigenome
### Drought Stress
Drought induces histone modifications such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, which are crucial for the expression of drought-responsive genes like Rd29A and AtGOLS2. DNA methylation changes are also tissue-specific, with roots showing lower methylation levels compared to leaves under drought conditions.

### Salt Stress
Salt stress leads to DNA methylation and demethylation changes, affecting gene expression. In wheat, salt stress results in specific changes in cytosine methylation patterns, while in soybean, it alters the expression of several transcription factors through DNA methylation and histone modifications.

### Heat Stress
Heat stress increases DNA methylation and histone acetylation levels, enhancing the expression of heat-responsive genes. In rice, mild heat stress reduces DNA methylation of the OsFIE1 gene, aiding in stress adaptation.

### Cold Stress
Cold stress induces histone deacetylation and changes in DNA methylation patterns. For example, in Zea mays, cold acclimation results in increased HDAC expression and subsequent deacetylation of histone subunits H3 and H4.

## Conclusion
Epigenetic modifications provide a mechanism for plants to adapt to various abiotic stresses, enhancing their survival and productivity. Understanding these processes can aid in developing crop improvement strategies to ensure sustainable agricultural production in the face of climate change and environmental challenges.


# Summary of Quantitative estimation of phenotypic plastic the gap between the evolutionary concept and applications

This study reviews methods for quantitatively estimating phenotypic plasticity (PP) and applies them to a case study involving four woody species (Quercus robur, Quercus pyrenaica, Pinus sylvestris, and Pinus pinaster) grown under different light conditions. The authors propose new methods for quantifying PP, particularly when traditional indices fall short due to non-linear trait responses. Key results and methods include:

1. **Review of Common Methods**: A detailed review of 17 different plasticity indices used in comparative ecological studies.
2. **Case Study**: Application of these indices to assess growth and shoot-root allocation in seedlings under varying light intensities (1%, 6%, 20%, and 100% full sunlight).
3. **New Indices**: Introduction of the Relative Distance Plasticity Index (RDPI) and the Environmentally Standardized Plasticity Index (ESPI), which allow for statistical comparisons of PP among species.


## Literature Review
A comprehensive review of studies from 1965 to 2005 was conducted to identify and analyze various indices used to quantify PP.

# Data Design Explanation

In the study, the experiment was designed to investigate the phenotypic plasticity of different tree species under varying light and water conditions. Here’s a detailed explanation of the data design:

## Experiment Design

### Factors and Levels
The experiment employed a 4 x 4 factorial design, where the two factors were:
1. **Irradiance Levels (Light Availability)**        
   - 1% Full Sunlight      
   - 6% Full Sunlight     
   - 20% Full Sunlight     
   - 100% Full Sunlight      

2. **Plant Species**    
   - Quercus robur (European Oak)     
   - Quercus pyrenaica (Pyrenean Oak)    
   - Pinus sylvestris (Scots Pine)    
   - Pinus pinaster (Maritime Pine)   

### Setup
Each combination of irradiance level and plant species was represented, resulting in a total of 16 treatment combinations (4 irradiance levels x 4 plant species). 


## Data Collection

### Measurements
1. **Shoot-Root Ratio**: A key trait measured in the study, representing the allocation of biomass between the above-ground (shoot) and below-ground (root) parts of the plants.
2. **Total Plant Biomass**: The dry mass of the entire plant, which was separated into leaves, stems, branches, and roots and dried to obtain accurate mass measurements.
3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Light availability (Photosynthetically Active Radiation - PAR) was recorded using external sensors and a data logger.

### Data Analysis
- **Indices of Phenotypic Plasticity**: Various indices were used to quantify phenotypic plasticity, such as the coefficient of variation, slope of the reaction norm, and the newly proposed Relative Distance Plasticity Index (RDPI).
- **Statistical Analysis**: One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences in growth (biomass) and shoot-root ratios among species. Interaction effects between species and light treatments were also analyzed.

## Summary
The factorial design of this experiment allowed for a comprehensive analysis of how different light conditions affect the growth and phenotypic plasticity of various tree species. By carefully controlling soil and water conditions and using multiple replicates, the study aimed to ensure robust and reliable results.

# Scores/indices to be implemented 

## Polynomial Reaction Norm

### Mathematical Formulation

To express the relationship between a phenotype (\(z(a)\)) and environmental gradient (\(a\)), the reaction norm is modeled as an \(m\)-degree polynomial:
\[
z(a) = b_0 + b_1 \cdot a + b_2 \cdot a^2 + \dots + b_m \cdot a^m
\]
Where:
- \(z(a)\) is the phenotype in environment \(a\),
- \(b_0\) is the intercept,
- \(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m\) are the coefficients representing the amount and pattern of phenotypic change across environments,
- \(m\) is one fewer than the number of environments.

### Coefficients as Plasticity Scores

- **Linear plasticity** is captured by the **first-order coefficient** \(b_1\), which represents the **slope** of the trait change across environments.
- **Non-linear plasticity** is captured by the **higher-order coefficients** \(b_2, b_3, \dots\), which represent more complex patterns of change (e.g., quadratic or cubic).
- The **plasticity score** is derived from the magnitude of these coefficients:
  \[
  \text{Plasticity Score} = |b_1| + |b_2| + \dots + |b_m|
  \]
  This score reflects both the magnitude and complexity of the phenotypic response across environments.

### Best Model Selection

- The **best-fitting polynomial model** (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) should be determined using statistical criteria such as **goodness-of-fit** or **AIC/BIC**.
- Nonlinear regression is used to estimate the coefficients for each genome.
- Once the best model is selected, the coefficients can be used to calculate the plasticity score for each genome. 

### Comparison with Pairwise Difference Method

An alternative measure of plasticity is the **difference in trait means** between two environments. This method is equivalent to using a **first-degree polynomial** (straight-line), which only captures the **magnitude** of change but not the **pattern**. While simple, it doesn't provide the same depth of information as polynomial regression.

## Drought Resistance Index (DRI) According to Fisher and Maurer (1978)

The **Drought Resistance Index (DRI)** was developed by Fisher and Maurer (1978) as an improvement over simply expressing yield under stress as a percentage of yield under non-stress conditions. The DRI compares the reduction in yield due to stress for a specific genotype against the mean reduction over all genotypes in the same test.

The formula for calculating DRI is:

\[
\text{DRI} = \left(\frac{Y_s}{Y_n}\right) / \left(\frac{M_s}{M_n}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( Y_s \) = yield (or biomass) of the specific genotype under stress.
- \( Y_n \) = yield (or biomass) of the specific genotype under non-stress.
- \( M_s \) = mean yield (or biomass) of all genotypes under stress.
- \( M_n \) = mean yield (or biomass) of all genotypes under non-stress.

This index reflects how well a specific genotype resists yield reduction under stress compared to others. Although some have argued that the index is biased by yield potential (with genotypes that perform better under non-stress conditions tending to show a lower DRI), this bias is rooted in biological grounds rather than being a statistical flaw, as discussed by Blum (1995).

This index is widely used by breeders as it accounts for both stress and non-stress yield performance and allows comparisons across genotypes.

## Drought Resistance Index (DRI) According to Bidinger et al. (1982)

The **Drought Resistance Index (DRI)** proposed by Bidinger et al. (1982) is used to assess drought resistance in cultivars by analyzing variation in grain yield under stress that cannot be explained by yield potential or drought escape (e.g., early flowering). Unlike traditional measures that rely solely on yield potential under stress or non-stress conditions, this DRI method isolates the specific drought resistance of a cultivar independent of these factors.

### Procedure for DRI Calculation:
1. **Initial Regression**: 
   - Yield under stress is regressed on potential yield (measured under non-stress) and drought escape (days to heading under non-stress) across all cultivars.
   - The estimated yield under stress for each cultivar is calculated from this regression.

2. **Second Regression**: 
   - The actual measured yield under stress is regressed on the estimated stress yield for each cultivar from the initial regression.
   - The deviation of each cultivar from this regression line indicates its drought resistance. A positive deviation suggests drought resistance, while a negative deviation suggests drought susceptibility.
   - The drought resistance of a cultivar is quantified as the **studentized residual** from this second regression, which can be calculated using most statistical software packages.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Cultivars with a positive deviation (or high residuals) are considered drought-resistant, while those with negative deviations are considered susceptible.
   - The magnitude of the index (residual) is important, with values greater than **1.3** typically indicating significant drought resistance.
   - While using this index in breeding programs, it is considered alongside other factors like absolute yield under stress, biotic stress resistance, and product quality.

## Variance of Polynomial Coefficients

### Mathematical Formulation

When genomes differ in their **reaction norm functions**, these differences can be captured by the **first and higher-order polynomial coefficients** (\(b_1, b_2, \dots\)). The **genetic variation for plasticity** is represented by the **variance among these coefficients**:
\[
Var(b_i), \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \dots, m
\]
This method quantifies genetic variation by capturing how genomes vary in terms of their **slopes and curvatures** across environments.

## Cross-environment Correlation/Covariance for Linear Norms

### Mathematical Formulation

For **linear reaction norms** or when there are **only two environments**, genetic variation can also be expressed as the **cross-environment correlation** or **covariance** between traits:
\[
Cov(z_1, z_2)
\]
Where \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) represent the trait values in two different environments. This method captures the **genetic variance for plasticity** by measuring the covariance in trait expressions across environments. For linear norms, the variance is simply related to the slope of the reaction norm.

## Eigenfunctions of Covariance Matrices (for Nonlinear Norms)

### Mathematical Formulation

For more complex, **nonlinear reaction norms**, a more advanced approach involves using **covariance matrices** and transforming them into **eigenfunctions**:
1. **Covariance matrix** of within-environment genetic variances and cross-environment covariances is generated.
2. **Eigenvectors** are derived from this matrix to describe the pattern of covariance:
   \[
   Cov(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) = \lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + \lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + \lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n
   \]
3. **Legendre polynomials** are used to convert these eigenvectors into continuous **eigenfunctions**:
   \[
   f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \cdot P_i(x)
   \]
   where \(P_i(x)\) are the Legendre polynomials. This method can handle **any shaped reaction norm** and is more comprehensive than the covariance method alone.

## Partitioning Phenotypic Variance (for Linear Norms)

### Mathematical Formulation

Another method is based on **variance partitioning** through **analysis of variance** (ANOVA). The **total phenotypic variance** can be divided into:
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{total}} = \sigma^2_g + \sigma^2_{\text{plasticity}}
\]
Where:
- \(\sigma^2_g\) is the genetic variance independent of the environment,
- \(\sigma^2_{\text{plasticity}}\) is the variance due to plastic effects (dependent on the environment).

For **linear reaction norms**, this method provides a simple measure of genetic variation for plasticity by partitioning the total variance.

## Genetic Variation for Plasticity in Linear Norms

### Mathematical Formulation

For **linear reaction norms**, Gavrilets & Scheiner (Adaptive phenotypic plasticity) provide an estimation of genetic variation for plasticity:
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{plasticity}} = g_1^2 \cdot Var(a)
\]
Where:
- \(g_1\) is the mean slope of the reaction norms across all families or genomes,
- \(Var(a)\) is the variance of the environmental gradient.

For **genetic variation for slopes**:
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{plasticity}} = G_1 \cdot Var(a)
\]
Where \(G_1\) is the genetic variation for the slopes, representing the **genetic variation for plasticity**.


## Genetic Variance and Heritability in Plasticity

From:GENETICS AND EVOLUTION OF PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY (Samuel M. Scheiner)

### Overview

Genetic variance is a key component in understanding how traits vary due to genetics and how these traits respond to selection. In the context of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variance explains how much of the variation in the plastic response (i.e., changes in traits across different environments) is due to genetic differences.

#### 1. Estimating Genetic Variance

The total phenotypic variance (\(\sigma^2_p\)) can be split into genetic variance (\(G\)) and environmental variance (\(E\)):

\[
\sigma^2_p = G + E
\]

Where:
- \(G\) represents the **genetic variance**, which accounts for differences between genotypes.
- \(E\) represents the **environmental variance**, which captures variation due to environmental differences.

Genetic variance is often estimated using experimental designs such as **full-sibling** or **half-sibling** designs. By comparing individuals with known relationships, it is possible to partition phenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components.

#### 2. Genetic Variance in Phenotypic Plasticity

For phenotypic plasticity, genetic variance is calculated by measuring how trait expression changes across environments (reaction norm). The **slope of the reaction norm** can be used to estimate the genetic variance for plasticity:

\[
G_1 = \text{Variance of the slope of the reaction norm across environments}
\]

This means that the genetic variance for plasticity depends on how much the slope (or shape) of the trait’s change across environments differs between genotypes.

#### 3. Heritability of Plasticity

Heritability in the context of plasticity refers to the proportion of phenotypic variation in plasticity that is due to genetic factors. Heritability measures are particularly important when making predictions about how a population might respond to selection.

### Heritability: Descriptive and Predictive Measures

#### 3.1 Descriptive Measures of Genetic Variation

When the goal is to understand the relative amounts of genetic variation that are dependent or independent of the environment, heritability is averaged across environments. Two key heritability measures exist for this purpose:

- **\( h_m^2 \)**: The heritability of the **environmentally independent portion** of the trait (mean trait value across environments).
- **\( h_{\pi}^2 \)**: The heritability of the **environmentally dependent portion** (plasticity).

These are calculated as follows:

\[
h_m^2 = \frac{G_0}{\sigma_p^2}, \quad h_{\pi}^2 = \frac{G_1}{\sigma_p^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G_0 \) is the genetic variance for the **mean trait** value across environments (environmentally independent portion).
- \( G_1 \) is the genetic variance for the **plasticity** (environmentally dependent portion).
- \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the total phenotypic variation across all environments.

These measures provide insight into the amount of genetic variation that influences traits and plasticity, helping to compare different traits, studies, and species on a scale-free metric.

#### 3.2 Predictive Measures for Plasticity Under Selection

When predicting the **response to selection on plasticity**, a different heritability measure is used. In this case, the heritability is often measured in the context of **family selection** on a plasticity index.

For family selection on plasticity, the heritability is calculated as:

\[
h_{\text{plasticity}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_f^2}{\sigma_p^2}
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma_f^2 \) is the genetic variation among families for the plasticity index.
- \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the total phenotypic variation for the plasticity index.

If the study involves only two environments, the plasticity index typically measures the **difference in family means** between environments. To obtain accurate heritability values, the total phenotypic variation must be corrected for errors in estimating family means.


## Water Use Efficiency (WUE) 

### Definition
Water use efficiency (WUE) represents the overall delivery efficiency of an irrigation system. It is mathematically defined as the ratio of the annual volume of crop water demand to the annual volume of irrigation supply:

\[
E_{WUE} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual volume of crop water demand (MCM)}}{\text{Annual volume of irrigation supply (MCM)}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

### Interpretation
- **Efficient system**: If the WUE value is greater than 60%, the irrigation system is considered efficient.
- **Good system**: A WUE value between 30% and 60% is classified as good.
- **Poor system**: A WUE value below 30% is regarded as poor, indicating inefficiency in water usage for crop demand.

## Multivariate Vector of Plasticity

The **Multivariate Vector of Plasticity** evaluates the distance moved by each trait between different environmental conditions. This multivariate approach considers multiple traits and calculates the Euclidean distance between the trait values in different environments.

### Mathematical Approach

The vector of plasticity for a given trait can be computed using the formula:

\[
\text{Vector of Plasticity} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + \cdots}
\]

Where:
- \(x_1, y_1, \ldots\) are the trait values in the first environment, and
- \(x_2, y_2, \ldots\) are the corresponding trait values in the second environment.

This formula calculates the Euclidean distance, representing the overall change in trait values across environments.

## θplast: Angle Between Vectors of Plasticity

This angle helps determine whether traits respond in similar or different directions under different environmental conditions.

## Plasticity Coefficient (PC)

### Mathematical Formulation

The **Plasticity Coefficient (PC)** is a simple measure of phenotypic plasticity, calculated as the relative change between the maximum and minimum trait values across environments, normalized by the average trait value.

\]

Where:
- **Maximum Trait Value**: The highest observed trait value across environments.
- **Minimum Trait Value**: The lowest observed trait value across environments.
- **Average Trait Value**: The mean of the trait values across environments.

### Citation
